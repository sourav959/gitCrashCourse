## Git and Github

> ### What is a "Version Controlling Tool" ?

* Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. As development environments have accelerated, version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter. They are especially useful for DevOps teams since they help them to reduce development time and increase successful deployments.

* Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.

> ### Git and SVN
* Git and SVN both are Version controlling tool. The difference between Git and SVN version control systems is that Git is a distributed version control system, whereas SVN is a centralized version control system. Git uses multiple repositories including a centralized repository and server, as well as some local repositories.

                        Git              ||          SVN

> * Git has a Distributed Model.	
> * SVN has a Centralized Model.

> * In git every user has their own copy of code on their local like their own branch.
> * In SVN there is central repository has working copy that also make changes and committed in central repository.

> * In git we do not required any Network to perform git operation.  
> * In SVN we required Network for runs the SVN operation. 

> * In git we create only .git directory.
> * In SVN we create .svn directory in each folder.

> * Git deals with large number of files like binary files that change quickly that why it become slow.
> * SVN control the large number of binary files easily.

> * Git is more difficult to learn. It has more concepts and commands. 
> * SVN is much easier to learn as compared to git.

> ### What is Git and why it is used ?
* Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.
> ### What is Github and why it is used ?
* Github is a web-based platform used for version control. Git simplifies the process of working with other people and makes it easy to collaborate on projects. Team members can work on files and easily merge their changes in with the master branch of the project.
